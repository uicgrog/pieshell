# PieShell

## Usage

In its nascent stages, please use ```npm start``` to start the React server.
In a different terminal instance use ```npm run electron``` to start running within an Electron window.

This will eventually be automated such that only one command will have to be executed to have both work in tandem.
For now, this will work as we become comfortable with the logistics of our new environment and begin implementing features.

*More to come soon.*
